`Predetermined Overhead Rate` = estimated overhead / allocation base
By creating a predetermined overhead rate, we are able to allocate the overhead costs towards different jobs to gain better understanding of where our costs come from.

The allocation base can come from a variety of different factors:

- Direct labor hours / direct labor dollars
- Direct material quantity / dollars
- Machine hours
- Units of production
