# Costing Overhead:

### Plant Wide Overhead Rate

Assumes:

- Overhead costs change in direct proportion production volume
- All products consume Overhead equally.

Advantages:

- Easy to compute and apply
- Meets financial reporting requirements
- Software available

Disadvantages:

- Not good for companies with many different products
- Decreasing direct labor trend in most markets

### Departmental Overhead Rate

Assumes:

- Different overhead rates for each processing department
- The correct driver of overhead can be identified

Advantages:

- More accurate allocation of overhead

Disadvantages:

- May not meet financial reporting requirements
- Increased complexity in computation
- May not find available software
- Assumes products consume overhead equally in each department.


### Activity Based Costing

Advantages:

- More effective cost allocation
- More effective management

Disadvantages:

- More costly to implement
- More effort involved in calculation
- Most systems do not support activity-based costing.

2 stage process:

1. Identify activities in manufacturing process
2. Compute activity overhead rate for each activity.

Activity Levels for Activity Based Costing

- Unit level - performed on each product (i.e. direct labor, utilities)
- Batch level - performed on each batch or group of products (i.e. machine setups, inspection)
- Product level - performed on each product line (i.e. engineering change to systems)
- Factory level - performed to sustain facility capacity, not caused by a specific product
