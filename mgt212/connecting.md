# Connecting/Relating to people
"No two people can experience the same thing in the same way." This makes the 
phrase "I understand", fairly pointless when trying to counsel someone. 

Three domains: Cognitive, affective, and psycho motor. 

- Cognitive (think/brain)
- Affective (feel)
- Psycho motor (action)

You see things (gather data), make decisions, and then produce actions. Usually
people only share cognitive deatils about an event and everyone has a slightly 
different cognitive perspective. Because each person has a cognitive perspective,
it is almost a sure thing that the affective and psycho motor results will be different.

Jesus did not have the same cognitive experiences as most of us. But, in Hebrews 4:14,
it talks about how Jesus did have similiar affective experiences. In our lives,
we need to focus on affective experiences.
