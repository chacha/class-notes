# Connecting/Relating to people
"No two people can experience the same thing in the same way." This makes the 
phrase "I understand", fairly pointless when trying to counsel someone. 

Three domains: Cognitive, affective, and psycho motor. 

- Cognitive (think/brain)
- Affective (feel)
- Psycho motor (action)

You see things (gather data), make decisions, and then produce actions.
