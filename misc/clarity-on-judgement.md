# Clarity on Judgement
Darin McWatters

Jesus warns about putting people in boxes that shame or classify them blindly

- Deciding that someone is bad because of their hair, looks, family, etc

The problem with judgement is that the immediate response is re-judgement

- "Judge not so that you might not be judged"
- The meaning of the verse is very simple.
- Many people take this to mean that God will use your measure against you, which goes against grace.

Jesus is **not** forbidding deciding if something is good or bad.

- Galatians 6:1
- Paul speaks about brothers using discretion to decide something is bad
- God discerns perfectly because he knows people's hearts, we don't. Therefore when we decide that someone is wrong or evil, we step over the line of discerning and into judgement if we decide to chase or reject them away. Rejecting people is never the first answer.
- Paul describes taking a transgressor and bringing them back into righteousness with gentleness.

Jesus warns about pointing out a speck in someone other's eyes when you have a log in your own eye

- The log is a judgemental heart
- You should remove your desire to cast people off before pointing out specks in other's eyes
- You must point out specks in other's eyes with a spirit of gentleness and restoration
- Romans 5

Jesus warns about feeding pearls to pigs

- Pigs don't need pearls
- We have pearls of wisdom from God that we too often force onto other people who aren't looking for them
- Work to figure out what it will take to reach other people

Jesus and Women at the Well

- He first regards her physical needs
- Later he deals with the spiritual problems
- What do people need to draw them to God?
