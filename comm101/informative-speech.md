Specific Purpose: To inform my audience about the growth of big box stores.

*Attention Getter/Credibility:* This weekend I didn’t go window shopping. I didn’t go to a mall and look at all the different stores trying to compete for my business. I didn’t even take a long time to decide where I was going to have lunch. If I wanted to, I could have filled my prescriptions, got my tires changed, gotten a car wash, or filled up my gas, all without having to leave a parking lot.   

*Reason for audience to listen:* Costco, like many other big box warehouse stores, is quickly expanding to become a greater part of our lives.   

*Central Idea/Preview:* Today, I want to explain just how prevalent Costco has become in our communities and how it will continue to spread, along with just how many services it offers, some of which you may have never heard of before.

*Main Point:* Costco has over the past years become a very big part of our culture:
* As of March 6th, 2014, there are 649 stores worldwide, 462 in the US (Company Profile, Costco.com)
* There are 71.2 million cardholders and 126,929 full-time and part time employees. (Company Profile, Costco.com)
* In 2010, more than 1.7 million transactions a day (Company Profile, Costco.com)
* In context, that means every time you have breathed 3 times Costco has made a sale
* In the places Costco opens, it has a big effect on the stores around it.
* A study published in the Southern Economic Journal states that Costco increases the prices in nearby grocery stores from 1% - 3% on average.

*Transition:* But, what are all of these stores offering? What are all of these members buying? The answer might surprise you.

Costco offers a wide variety of services. Some of these services are expected:
* Groceries, clothing, office, sports, etc
* Prescriptions
* Food Court

Some of these services are out of the ordinary for big box stores:
* Gas
* Car Wash
* Water Delivery
* Auto & Home Insurance
* Dental Plans
* Health Insurance

*Transition:* You might be like, “Awesome!” Where do I sign up? Lucky for you, Costco is quickly expanding.

*Main Point:* Costco is quickly expanding
* 25 stores opened in 2013 alone (Company Profile, Costco.com)

*Summarize Thesis/Main Point:* Costco is quickly become a much bigger part of our lives. 
*Closure:* I hope knowing this information will help you to be aware of the growth that is happening in Big Box stores, and that you can choose where you shop with it in mind.
