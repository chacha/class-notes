#Asian Theatre

There is a lack of communication between Asia and Eastern/Western Europe because of the distance between the two areas.


All Asian theaters were unique, however there are some similarities.

* They relied more on dance than acting
* Usually not very much talking but instead focus on actions
* Emphasize symbolism

**Total Theatre**: The synthesis or integration of elements â€” acting, mime, dancing, music and text - into a single cohesive experience

##Indian Theatre

### Sanskrit Dramas
**Sanskrit** is the language of the noble classes. Between 50 and 60 Sanskrit plays are all that remain from the Indian golden age.

The **Natyasastra** (The Study of Theatre) describes the mythological origin of theatre in India and also presents important material about the nature of Indian drama.


## Chinese Theatre


### Early Chinese Theatre
Theatre was linked to the patronage of the imperial court

Involved skits, pantomimes, juggling, singing and dancing. Most of the performances were small and didn't resemble the big events that theatre is today.

The **Pear Garden** was an actors' training institute in the capital.

There were traveling theatrical troupes that performed slapstick and other widely enjoyable comedies for the lower class.

###Yuan Dynasty

Ruled by the Mongols, who dismantled the traditional bureaucracy

This was the beginning of the development of Chinese theatre, as the rulers threw out the old undignified sense of theatre and started over.
* Out of work literati, who had formerly disdained plays, took up theatrical work to make a living
* Women performed on stage, which was unheard of in other cultures
* Theaters were minimal, with a bare stage, doors on either side, and a painted cloth.

During this period, theatre was very similar to that of Greece

### Ming Dynasty

Mongols of the Yuan Dynasty were replaced by a Chinese emperor.
* Restored traditional patterns of social behavior, and theatre became more ornate and artificial
* Became more literary and complicated in structure
* Actors were permitted to sing
* Lost connection with the broad masses
