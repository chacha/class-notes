###Proscenium or Picture-Frame Stage
A stage that is framed in front of the audience, the **proscenium stage** is the most common type of stage. It is called a fourth-wall theatre because if the stage was a box, the fourth wall would be removed for the audience to look in through. 

The fourth wall concept is very important because the proscenium stage has ample room for hiding things off-stage. The sides of the stage are lined by masking to hide things in the wings. It is ideal for spectacles because of the invisibility provided by the frame of the stage. 

However, a proscenium theatre tends to be remote and formal instead of intimate because the audience can be far away from the action.

###Thrust Stage
The **thrust stage** juts out into the audience, which is seated on three sides of the stage. This mimics the look of a greek amphitheater, which is popular because of the increased audience visibility. 

However this visibility makes masking things less viable than a proscenium stage because scenery is visible from three sides instead of just one side

###Arena Stage
Also called a circle theatre, or theatre-in-the-round, the **arena stage** has a playing space in the center of a square or circle, with seats for spectators surrounding it. It offers intimacy, and allows or unconscious communication created by people in circles. It can easily be created as a part of any large room.

###Created/Found Spaces
A theatre setup in a place not usually used for performance is becoming more popular. An example of this type of theatre space is street theatre.

###Multi-focus Environments
A stage with more than a single playing area with things going on in different areas is called a *Multi-focus Environment*. This type of space is unique because it creates multiple spaces where no activity happening in a  single space is more important than any other.

The biggest example of a multi-focus environment is a three-ring circus.

###All Purpose/Experimental Spaces
Spaces that can be adapted to an almost infinite range of configurations are all purpose or experimental spaces. Seats, stages, lights, and other pieces are flexible/movable to fit the various performances that the area will host.
