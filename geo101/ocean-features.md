**Rifting**: The ocean pulling apart

Studying the seafloor:
* Sonar through boats mapping the ocean
* Satellites can see how the water is deformed based on the sea geology

##Continental Margins
Places where the ocean meets the continent are called continental margins.

###Passive Margin
A Passive margin is a margin that is not involved in the meeting of tectonic plates includes continental shelves, slopes, and rises.
* **Shelves**: gentle slopes extending to around 140m deep
* **Slopes**: steeper drops from the shelf down to the continental rise
* **Rises**: gentler slope between the continental slope and the deep ocean floor
* **Submarine Canyons**: breaks in continental shelves/slopes creating deep trenches
* **Turbidity Currents**: underwater avalanches that mix water and rock/debris. Usually starts at the top of a continental shelf and moves downward
Can create submarine canyons along with abyssal fans
* **Abyssal fans** are spread out sediment created by turbidity currents

###Active Margins
An active margin is created by the meeting of two tectonic plates
* Can be a part of a transform or convergent tectonic boundary
includes continental shelves, steeper slopes, and trenches (instead of rises)
* **Trenches**: narrow and deep trough created when the oceanic plate is subducting. Can result in some of the deepest places in the ocean
* The active margin in California creates a Continental borderland

###Abyssal Plains and Hills
Flat and featureless areas, created by thick sediment that covers a large subsurface of basalt, and generally contains  clays and oozes.
* Loaded with benthic organisms that burrow in sediment (called Bioturbation)
* Abyssal Hills are tops of volcanic peaks sticking out from the sediment

###Mid-oceanic ridge
A giant undersea mountain range that extends around the world.
* Mostly made of basalt
* Has fracture zones where the ridge is discontinuous created by transform faults

**Seamounts** along the ridge are isolated basaltic volcanoes
* When flattened by waves, called **guyots**
* **Aseismic ridges** are chains of seamounts.

**Hydrothermal Vents**
* Cold water is drawn into oceanic crust
* It is then heated by hot magma under the crust
* Hot springs/black smokers shoot it back out into the ocean
* Creates places for biological communities due to the warm water

**Mantle-plume hypothesis**: Hot plumes of rock rise from the deep mantle and reach the surface, creating hotspots.
This hypothesis leads us to the plate-tectonic theory which explains the relatively young age of the oceanic crust.

####Reefs
Made up of Wave resistant coral and other calcareous organisms.
* Fringing Reefs encircle the island
* Barrier Reefs run parallel to the coast surround the island
* Atolls rim around circular lagoons

###Seafloor Sediments

**Lithogenous Sediment**: Land derived sediment. Creates continental rises and abyssal plains

**Pelagic Sediment**: microscopic organisms and fine-grained clay that settle through the water

#### Earth's Crust Makeup
**Oceanic Crust**: Made up of Pillow Lavas, Sheeted Dykes, Gabbro Intrusions, resting on a layer of ultrabasic rock.

**Continental Crust**: Made of a giant layer of granitic basement followed by ultrabasic rock

* Ophiolite Suite
* Axial Magma Chamber
* Pelagic Sediments
* Pillow Basalts
* Sheeted Basaltic Dykes
* Intrusive, Layered Gabbro
* Dunite/Peridotite Cumulates
